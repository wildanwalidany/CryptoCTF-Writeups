# Parameter Injection
Platform: Cryptohack

## Description
> Now it's time to calculate a shared secret using data received from your friend Alice. Like before, we will be using the NIST parameters:
> You're in a position to not only intercept Alice and Bob's DH key exchange, but also rewrite their messages. Think about how you can play with the DH equation that they calculate, and therefore sidestep the need to crack any discrete logarithm problem.
> Use the script from "Diffie-Hellman Starter 5" to decrypt the flag once you've recovered the shared secret.
