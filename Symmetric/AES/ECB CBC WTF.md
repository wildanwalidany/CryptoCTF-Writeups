## Description

> ECB is the most simple mode, with each plaintext block encrypted entirely independently. In this case, your input is prepended to the secret flag and encrypted and that's it. We don't even provide a decrypt function. Perhaps you don't need a padding oracle when you have an "ECB oracle"?

`play at:` [ecb_oracle](https://aes.cryptohack.org/ecb_oracle)

`source:`

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad, unpad


KEY = ?
FLAG = ?


@chal.route('/ecb_oracle/encrypt/<plaintext>/')
def encrypt(plaintext):
    plaintext = bytes.fromhex(plaintext)

    padded = pad(plaintext + FLAG.encode(), 16)
    cipher = AES.new(KEY, AES.MODE_ECB)
    try:
        encrypted = cipher.encrypt(padded)
    except ValueError as e:
        return {"error": str(e)}

    return {"ciphertext": encrypted.hex()}
```

## Solution

<!-- This code section is a work in progress - TODO: Update with the solucion -->

**flag:** `flag`
