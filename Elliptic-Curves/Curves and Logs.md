# Curves and Logs

Platform: Cryptohack

## Description

> Using the curve, prime and generator: $E: Y^{2}=X^{3}+497X+1768, p:9739, G: (1804,5368)$
> Calculate the shared secret after Alice sends you $Q_{A} = (815, 3190)$ , with your secret integer $n_{B} = 1829$.
> Generate a key by calculating the SHA1 hash of the `x` coordinate (take the integer representation of the coordinate and cast it to a string). The flag is the hexdigest you find.

## Solution

<!-- This code section is a work in progress - TODO: Update with the solucion -->

**flag:** `flag`
