# Point Negation

Platform: Cryptohack

## Description

> For all the challenges in the starter set, we will be working with the elliptic curve
>`E: Y2 = X3 + 497 X + 1768, p: 9739`
> Using the above curve, and the point `P(8045,6936)`, find the point `Q(x,y)` such that `P + Q = O`.

## Solution

In Elliptic Curve Addition Algorithm, there is case:
If \(x_1 = x_2\) and \(y_1 = -y_2\), then \(P_1 + P_2 = \mathcal{O}\)
