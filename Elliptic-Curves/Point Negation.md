# Point Negation

Platform: Cryptohack

## Description

> For all the challenges in the starter set, we will be working with the elliptic curve $E: Y^{2}=X^{3}+497X+1768, p:9739$
> Using the above curve, and the point $P(8045,6936)$, find the point $Q(x,y)$ such that $P + Q = O$.

## Solution

In Elliptic Curve Addition Algorithm, there is case where:

If $x_{1}= x_{2}$ and $y_{1} = âˆ’y_{2}$, then $P_{1} + P_{2} = O$

So, $Q(x,y)=Q(x_{P},-y_{P})$. In other word, $Q=-P$

$-y_{P}$ is additive inverse of $y_{P}$ which satisfies $y_{P}+(-y_{P})=0$

Additive Inverse = (-yp) % p = (-10) % 17 = 7 # not yet
